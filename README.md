# Machine Learning: Solubility Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the solubility of compounds (LogS) using Machine Learning techniques.  
Two models were implemented and compared:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

This project is a step forward in my journey into Machine Learning, where I aim to explore data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
